### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

In May 2023, I successfully completed a coding bootcamp with a focus on data at neuefische. I have lost my heart to Data Science.

I have learned a lot of tools and technologies and would now like to use them in various projects and also professionally.

I will post here some exciting projects I am working on.

Thank you for your interest in my profile!

Johanna
